# `xdevs_no_std.rs`

`no_std` version of xDEVS for Rust.

## Run Real-Time DEVS simulations on embedded devices!

This crate is mainly focused on enabling the execution of Real-Time simulations on embedded devices.
This allows a robust Model-Based design approach, from a mathematical model to a real IoT application.

## Work in progress!

There is still a lot of work to do! However, we already proved the effectiveness of this simulator.
We are currently working on better `async` support, as well as aligning the simulator to the
Embassy project to benefit from such a great ecosystem. Keep in tune!
