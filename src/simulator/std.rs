///  # Arguments
///
///  * `t_start` - The virtual time at the beginning of the simulation.
///  * `time_scale` - The time scale factor between virtual and wall-clock time.
///  * `max_jitter` - The maximum allowed jitter duration. If `None`, no jitter check is performed.
///  * `input_handler` - The function to handle incoming external events. This function expects two arguments:
///    - `duration: [Duration]` - Maximum duration of the time interval to wait for external events.
///      The input handler function may return earlier if an input event is received.
///      Note, however, that it must **NOT** return after, as it would result in an incorrect real-time implementation.
///    - `input_ports: &mut T` - Mutable reference to the input ports of the top-most model under simulation.

///  # Returns
///
///  A closure that takes the next virtual time and a mutable reference to the bag and returns the next virtual time.
